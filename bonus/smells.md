### Design and Code Smells:
1. **Mixing Business Logic with Database Access:**
   - The `BookDao` class contains methods that handle both business logic (creating a new book, getting a book by ID, etc.) and database access logic (managing Entity Manager, persisting entities, querying the database). This violates the Single Responsibility Principle and makes the class harder to maintain and test.

2. **EntityManager Dependency in DAO Class:**
   - The `getEntityManager` method in the `BookDao` class directly accesses the `ThreadLocalContext` to get the EntityManager. This tightly couples the DAO class with the persistence context, making it harder to swap out different persistence mechanisms in the future.

3. **Handling Exceptions in DAO Class:**
   - The `BookDao` class catches `NoResultException` and returns null for methods like `getById` and `getByIsbn`. This is not a good practice as it hides potential issues and makes it harder to handle errors and provide meaningful feedback at higher layers.

4. **Hard-Coded Query in DAO Class:**
   - The `getByIsbn` method in the `BookDao` class has a hard-coded query string for fetching a book by its ISBN number. This ties the implementation to a specific query, making it less flexible for changes and potentially opening up SQL injection vulnerabilities.

5. **Returning ID as String:**
   - The `create` method in the `BookDao` class returns the Book ID as a String. Using a String for IDs can lead to ambiguity and inconsistent handling, especially when interacting with other parts of the application.

6. **Lack of Transaction Management:**
   - There is no transaction management in the `BookDao` class. Transactions are essential for ensuring data consistency and integrity in a database system. This can lead to potential data corruption or inconsistencies if transactions are not managed properly.

7. **Limited Error Handling:**
   - The error handling in the `BookDao` class is limited to catching `NoResultException`. Proper error handling mechanisms, like logging errors or throwing custom exceptions, are missing, making it challenging to diagnose and address issues.
